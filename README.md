# Vietnamese.g3l file version 1.01
---
The Vietnamese.g3l file is a language file designed specifically for Casio Prizm calculators (such as fx-CG10, fx-CG50). This file contains Vietnamese text strings to display the calculator's user interface, including menus, error messages, prompts, and function labels. The main purpose is to help Vietnamese users use the calculator more easily by switching the interface to Vietnamese.

When loaded into a Casio Prizm calculator, the Vietnamese.g3l file replaces the default English text with Vietnamese, such as "Bat dau" instead of "Start" or "Loi ket noi" instead of "Connection Error".

Currently in development, it is limited in that it does not have accents and is quite limited when put on the machine.
